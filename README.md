Below is a corrected GitHub-compatible version of the README. The content after the WallyToken code example is no longer stuck inside a snippet. Notice how we properly close the code fence with three backticks before starting the subsequent sections.

# Wally Token Ecosystem

Welcome to the **Wally** token repository!  
Here you‚Äôll find all the Solidity smart contracts and supporting code for the **Wally** DeFi ecosystem, including:

- **WallyToken** ‚Äì Your primary ERC20 token with advanced anti-bot and sniping protection.  
- **WallyStaking** ‚Äì A time-locked staking system with dynamic APYs.  
- **WallyVesting** ‚Äì Linear vesting for team/foundation tokens with cliff and optional revocation.  
- **WallyAirdrop** ‚Äì A simple airdrop contract for batch token distributions.

> **Note**: Always audit and test thoroughly before deploying to mainnet.

## Overview

The **Wally** ecosystem is designed to bring together **DeFi** capabilities and **community-driven** initiatives. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown:

- **Zero-Tax ERC20** token with advanced features.  
- **DAO Governance** integration using `AccessControl`.  
- **Anti-Bot Tools**: trading toggle, cooldowns, blacklisting, sniper protection.  
- **Time-Locked Staking** for sustainable rewards.  
- **Linear Vesting** for controlled token distribution.  
- **Batch Airdrops** for community events or marketing campaigns.  

Feel free to explore, customize, and build upon these contracts to fit your project‚Äôs unique needs!

## Contracts

### 1. WallyToken ‚ôªÔ∏è

A zero-tax ERC20 token with:

- **DAO or Multi-Sig Control** via `ADMIN_ROLE`.  
- **Anti-Bot Tools**: trading toggle, max transaction limit, blacklist, optional cooldown, time-based or block-based sniper protection.  
- **Minting/Burning** restricted via `MINTER_ROLE` and `BURNER_ROLE`.  
- **Rescue Functions** to recover stuck ERC20 tokens or ETH.  
- **Front-Running Mitigation** in the `approve` function (optional override).

<details>
<summary>Sample Interface</summary>

```solidity
contract WallyToken is ERC20, AccessControl {
    constructor(address _router) ERC20("Wally Token", "TWG") {
        // ...
    }
    function setTradingEnabled(bool _enabled) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) { ... }
    // ...
}

</details>
```

2. WallyStaking üí∞

A staking contract with:
	‚Ä¢	Multiple Lock Durations (3, 6, or 12 months).
	‚Ä¢	Simple APY Calculation (reward = principal * APY * time).
	‚Ä¢	Time-Locked Withdrawals ensuring fairness and reducing volatility.
	‚Ä¢	Admin Control to set APYs, rescue leftover tokens, etc.

Stakers deposit WallyToken into WallyStaking and later withdraw both principal + rewards.

3. WallyVesting ‚è∞

For distributing tokens over time:
	‚Ä¢	Linear Vesting: Tokens release continuously between start and start + duration.
	‚Ä¢	Cliff: No tokens released before the cliff time.
	‚Ä¢	Revocable by an admin, returning unvested tokens back to the DAO.
	‚Ä¢	Per-Beneficiary Deployment: Typically one vesting contract per recipient.

Great for team allocations, partner distributions, or lockups.

4. WallyAirdrop üéÅ

For batch distributing tokens:
	‚Ä¢	Single Transaction to a list of recipients.
	‚Ä¢	Prefunded with tokens by the admin.
	‚Ä¢	Rescue function to retrieve leftover tokens if needed.

Perfect for community rewards, event giveaways, or marketing campaigns.

Development

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/wally-token.git
cd wally-token


	2.	Install dependencies (e.g., Foundry or Hardhat):

# Using Foundry
forge install

# OR using NPM for Hardhat
npm install


	3.	Configure your hardhat.config.js, foundry.toml, or relevant config files.

Compilation
	‚Ä¢	Hardhat:

npx hardhat compile


	‚Ä¢	Foundry:

forge build

Testing
	‚Ä¢	Hardhat (JavaScript/TypeScript tests):

npx hardhat test


	‚Ä¢	Foundry (Solidity tests):

forge test



Explore the test/ directory for sample tests covering each contract.
Make sure you have a local node or test environment running if needed.

Deployment
	1.	Deploy WallyToken by passing the Uniswap Router address in the constructor.
	2.	Grant Roles (ADMIN_ROLE, MINTER_ROLE, BURNER_ROLE) to your DAO or multi-sig.
	3.	(Optional) Deploy WallyStaking and fund it with tokens to cover reward payouts.
	4.	(Optional) Deploy WallyVesting for each beneficiary/team member, then transfer allocated tokens to each vesting contract.
	5.	(Optional) Deploy WallyAirdrop and pre-fund it for batch distributions.

Always verify addresses and calls on testnets (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia) before mainnet deployment.

Security & Audits üîí
	‚Ä¢	Third-Party Audits are highly recommended for all production code.
	‚Ä¢	Role Management: The ADMIN_ROLE has significant power (mint, burn, toggle trading, blacklist, etc.), so store this in a multi-sig or a DAO.
	‚Ä¢	Anti-Bot features: Thoroughly test your trading toggle, blacklisting, and cooldown logic to ensure a smooth launch.
