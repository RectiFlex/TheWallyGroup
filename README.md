Overview

The Wally ecosystem is designed to bring together DeFi capabilities and community-driven initiatives. Here‚Äôs a quick rundown:
	‚Ä¢	Zero-Tax ERC20 token with advanced features.
	‚Ä¢	DAO Governance integration using AccessControl.
	‚Ä¢	Anti-Bot Tools: trading toggle, cooldowns, blacklisting, sniper protection.
	‚Ä¢	Time-Locked Staking for sustainable rewards.
	‚Ä¢	Linear Vesting for controlled token distribution.
	‚Ä¢	Batch Airdrops for community events or marketing campaigns.

Feel free to explore, customize, and build upon these contracts to fit your project‚Äôs unique needs!

Contracts

1. WallyToken ‚ôªÔ∏è

A zero-tax ERC20 token with:
	‚Ä¢	DAO Ownership or multi-sig control via ADMIN_ROLE.
	‚Ä¢	Anti-Bot Tools:
	‚Ä¢	Trading toggle (enables/disables public transfers).
	‚Ä¢	Blacklist for malicious actors.
	‚Ä¢	Max transaction limit for early-phase controls.
	‚Ä¢	Optional cooldown period between user transfers.
	‚Ä¢	Time-based (or block-based) sniper protection.
	‚Ä¢	Minting/Burning restricted by MINTER_ROLE and BURNER_ROLE.
	‚Ä¢	Rescue Functions to recover stuck ERC20 tokens or ETH.

// Pseudocode snippet
contract WallyToken is ERC20, AccessControl {
    constructor(address _router) ERC20("Wally Token", "TWG") {
        // ...
    }
    function setTradingEnabled(bool _enabled) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) { ... }
    // ...
}

2. WallyStaking üí∞

A staking system designed to reward users who lock up their Wally tokens. Features:
	‚Ä¢	Multiple Lock Durations (3, 6, or 12 months).
	‚Ä¢	Simple APY Calculation: Earn more by locking longer!
	‚Ä¢	Admin Control to set APYs, rescue leftover tokens, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Time-Locked Withdrawals ensuring fairness.

Stakers deposit WallyToken into WallyStaking, then later withdraw principal + rewards.

3. WallyVesting ‚è∞

For distributing tokens over a defined schedule:
	‚Ä¢	Linear Vesting: Tokens release continuously from start to start + duration.
	‚Ä¢	Cliff: No tokens released before the cliff.
	‚Ä¢	Revocable by Admin: Unvested tokens can be reclaimed if necessary.
	‚Ä¢	One Beneficiary per Contract or use a factory for multiple.

Perfect for team allocations, partner distributions, and reducing sell pressure!

4. WallyAirdrop üéÅ

A simple batch distribution contract to spread Wally tokens:
	‚Ä¢	Prefunded by the admin.
	‚Ä¢	Single Transaction to airdrop tokens to a list of recipients.
	‚Ä¢	Rescue function for leftover tokens.

Ideal for marketing campaigns, community giveaways, or promotional events.

Development

Installation
	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/wally-token.git
cd wally-token


	2.	Install dependencies (e.g., Foundry or Hardhat):

# Using Foundry
forge install

# Or using NPM for Hardhat
npm install


	3.	Configure hardhat.config.js or foundry.toml as needed.

Compilation
	‚Ä¢	Hardhat:

npx hardhat compile


	‚Ä¢	Foundry:

forge build



Testing
	‚Ä¢	Hardhat (JavaScript tests):

npx hardhat test


	‚Ä¢	Foundry (Solidity tests):

forge test



Explore the test/ directory for examples covering each contract. Ensure you have a local node or test environment running if needed.

Deployment
	1.	Deploy WallyToken by passing the Uniswap Router address in the constructor.
	2.	Grant Roles (ADMIN_ROLE, MINTER_ROLE, BURNER_ROLE) to your DAO or multi-sig.
	3.	(Optional) Deploy WallyStaking and fund it with enough tokens to cover rewards.
	4.	(Optional) Deploy WallyVesting for each beneficiary/team member. Transfer allocated tokens to each vesting contract.
	5.	(Optional) Deploy WallyAirdrop, pre-fund it, and distribute tokens to your community.

Always verify your addresses and calls on a testnet (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia) before mainnet deployment.

Security & Audits üîí
	‚Ä¢	Third-Party Audits are highly recommended for all production code.
	‚Ä¢	Role Management: Be mindful of powerful roles like ADMIN_ROLE ‚Äì keep them on a multi-sig or DAO governance.
	‚Ä¢	Anti-Bot features: Thoroughly test your trading toggle, cooldowns, blacklisting, and sniper checks to ensure a smooth launch.
